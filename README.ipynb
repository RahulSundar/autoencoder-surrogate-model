    "The objective of this work is to develop a surrogate model for the Rayleigh-Bénard convection problem, which is a type of natural convection occurring in a horizontal plane layer of fluid heated from the bottom. The surrogate model to be developed will be based on Neural Networks and dimensionality reduction. Thus, it is necessary to have data that describes the flow in the problem to train the neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data will be generated using the [OpenLB](https://www.openlb.net/) library, which is a library that implements the lattice Boltzmann method. Therefore, different conditions for the Rayleigh-Bénard convection will be simulated using this library, and then, the simulated output will be used to train the neural networks. The Rayleigh-Bénard convection problem simulation using the OpenLB is shown.\n",

This file is then used as an argument for the Python script [`multi_thread.py`](multi_thread.py).

    "As commonly known, the preprocessing data step is important for neural networks and machine learning algorithms. Thus, after generated the HDF5 file by [`multi_thread.py`](multi_thread.py) script, the data was preprocessed to remove cases where there were positive or negative infinity values or not a number values in any of the time steps of a given simulation. Moreover, after pruning the cases with invalid values, the remained cases were standardized, according to:\n",

It outputs a new HDF5 file where the scaled and unscaled data are stored. The script mix the data from all study cases as a single dataset. In this case, the dataset has four dimensions, the first dimension is the sample, the second and third are the spatial distribution and the third the problem output variables, which are in this order pressure, temperature and velocity. After preprocessed the simulated data from OpenLB, $16$ simulations were found to have some problems related to positive or negative infinity values or not a number values. Therefore, they were removed from the analysis, and only $14$ were kept.\n",
